abstract: >
  EurekaMesh CCAD is a research-grade framework for steering large language
  models towards novel, valid hypotheses by combining domain-specific
  canonicalization, exact and fuzzy de-duplication (ECFP4/Tanimoto), and
  adaptive context (recent uniques, RAG prototypes). The publish subset
  provides a fully reproducible pipeline with tests, A/B/C experiments,
  structured logging, figures, and an HTML report.
